 	<h1>The MCAT</h1>
 	<p>The Medical College Admission Test(MCAT) is a standardized test that medical
 	schools use to screen applicants and predict a students success in medical school and
 	their field of medicine. In other words, it is just like the SAT's for medical
 	school.</p>
 	<p> The MCAT consists of many different subjects. About 50% of the content is not
 	science. The scientific subjects consist of Biology, General Chemistry, Organic
 	Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Physics. The rest includes Sociology, Psychology, and
 	Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills(CARS). CARS makes up about a fourth of the
 	whole exam.</p>
